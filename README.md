# VulnerabilityTest01
Please read the README file  for more information 
First I have created an application with the vulnerabilites 
Second I have created an application with a vulnerability 
Summary of What I did for the Application before and after: For this vulnerability to start with preg.match() where the alphanumeric characters, dashes, and period. Then the escapeshellarg function to not unsafe characters before using the shell_exec(). This prevents command injection by using a hostname or IP address that uses the ping command. You can also use a firewall to limit access privileges and permission for the specific user. 
Teaching to other people:
  1. The audience I am speaking to is a developer audience so please keep that in mind. 
  2. I will explain the concept of User Input validataion.
      a. Explain the process f ensuring that any input received from a user is safe and within expected parameters.
      b. Talk about the exploitation of malicous users can exploit variables in user input to inject malicous code.
  4. Explaining vulnerable code with a the examples of my code where a user is not validated g passed to the shell_exec() function. 
          a. Explain the shell command and what it is (the attacker could potentially inject malicous code into systems). 
  6. How to patch the vulnerability 
      a. Implementing input validaation using a whitelist approach.
      b. By defining a whitelist approach set of known safe characters and only allowing input that matches this set. In the patch code provided, this is achieved using a regular expression that checks if the input contains only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and period. 
      c. Then talk about escapeshellarg() by adding the backslashes for the characters
  8. Protecting against this vulnerability using a Web application firewall. 
  9. I would be doing a power point and add in some comedy to it by using movie examples.
